# Camera-Roll CMS

Camera-Roll is a headless CMS for photographer portfolios.
It focuses on organizing the artwork in an intuitive way. 
Pictures are categorized into arbitrary amount of user defined tags, 
and the CMS provides APIs for sourcing data under each tag. 
It also supports customizable albums, 
which photographers may find useful to group together pictures from the same project.

Again, this CMS is built for photographers.
There is no WordPress jargon such as posts and users which were meant for blogs.
They don't make sense in the world of aperture, shutter speed and ISO.
